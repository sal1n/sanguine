===============================================================================

Sanguine is a Warhammer-themed roguelike game written in Ruby using the Gosu 
2D graphics library.

To play you need the following installed:

*   Ruby, preferably version 1.9+  [ http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ ]

*   Gosu, 'gem install gosu'  [http://www.libgosu.org/]

*   JSL Ancient font installed (it will work without but it looks better with
 	the font).  You can find the font file in /resources.

To play simply 'ruby play.rb' from the command line, et voila!

NOTES:

The game is currently unfinished!

1.	To experience combat hang around where you start.  Orcs are unlimited
    so kill a couple just to get an explosive dagger as an example of AoE 
	effects.  
	
2.	To check out the basic map generation go down the stairs and have a look,
    the top level is hand-drawn - the rest are procedurally generated.

3.	commands:
				e = equip
				g = get
				d = drop
				x = view equipment
				i = view inventory
				> = go down stairs
				..
				look in the relevant state to see what else there is.
				
4.	Not sure I've put diagonal movement in yet.  You can't move up stairs.

5.	Graphics aren't final.  Tile Z-Ordering needs sorting.  Walls need proper
	joining.

6.	Need to do content - creatures and items!

7.	Need to do classes and races!

Game engine is pretty much done, it's mainly tweaking, balancing and content required.

Not entirely sure when I will get around to finishing the game now, but if anyone gets
any use out of the code I'll be glad.

Have fun.
